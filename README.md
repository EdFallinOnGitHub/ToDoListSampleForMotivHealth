# To-Do List

The To-Do List sample application has two major pieces: client and server, both in this repository.

## ToDoListClient

An Angular app that displays the to-do list and provides ways for it to be changed.


## ToDoListServer

A Web API app that provides the to-do list contents to the client, stores them, and supports changes to them.
